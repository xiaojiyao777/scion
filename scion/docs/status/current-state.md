# Scion v0.4 Current State

*Last updated: 2026-05-11*

This file is the short operational snapshot for onboarding and day-to-day
handoff. Historical repair and experiment notes were moved to
[`v0.4-history.md`](v0.4-history.md). Detailed experiment analyses live under
[`../experiments/v0.4/`](../experiments/v0.4/).

## Status

v0.4 is not ready for long CVRP solver-quality validation. The framework
governance path is largely behaving, but CVRP short diagnostics still have not
produced reliable screening-quality improvement. The latest forced
`destroy_repair_policy` enum-interface rerun validates the governance and
adapter plumbing, but it also shows that the recent direction has become too
incremental: Scion is being asked to optimize one exposed policy hook at a
time. That is not the intended research object. The next direction is a
problem-object adaptation pivot: Scion should receive a coherent CVRP problem
object and solver-design boundary through the adapter, then reason about the
solver at the problem level. Do not start another forced single-policy
diagnostic until that adaptation slice is designed.

Current branch: `v0.4-dev`

Current interpretation:

- Scion core remains problem-agnostic: proposal observations are tainted,
  Decision does not read proposal text, and problem semantics stay behind
  adapters/problem packages.
- Forced single-surface diagnostics have done their job for governance and
  runtime-audit validation. They should not continue as the main optimization
  path.
- CVRP `main_search_strategy` and the deep mechanism policy family are useful
  implementation hooks, but they are not the right research abstraction by
  themselves. The next slice should expose the CVRP problem object and a
  top-level solver-design boundary, not another isolated policy knob.
- The higher-ceiling v3 path should be a problem-object adaptation path:
  instance model, solution model, objective policy, move/design affordances,
  solver lifecycle, and whole-solver evidence should be rendered by the adapter
  as one coherent object for Scion to reason over.
- APS observation handling for CVRP deep-surface diagnostics now uses the 48k
  default, compact 800-character surface code previews, and an explicit
  terminal reserve for schema/target/interface/Contract previews after
  required diagnosis context has been gathered.
- The latest free-surface post-optimization smoke selected two newly added
  deep mechanism surfaces: `alns_vns_policy` and
  `acceptance_restart_policy`. `destroy_repair_policy` and
  `route_pair_candidate_policy` still were not selected.
- ALNS/VNS attribution is now explainable: the selected `alns_vns_policy`
  candidate recorded nonzero `alns_vns_phase_delta_sum`, construction-start
  distance, returned baseline distance, and objective deltas. This validates
  attribution plumbing, not solver efficacy.
- APS self-check reservation now preserves tool calls and observation-char
  headroom for compact schema/target/interface/Contract previews. The latest
  forced diagnostics reached final self-checks without `result_too_large`; the
  enum-interface rerun's Contract preview passed for all 7 completed code
  sessions.
- Forced-surface controls fail closed, and the final hypothesis-generation task
  now narrows `change_locus`, `action`, and `target_file` to active forced
  values instead of presenting the full surface list. The latest forced
  `destroy_repair_policy` rerun validated this in real APS traces.
- The latest code also makes `destroy_repair_policy` selector levers real:
  `route_diverse_worst` changes destroy ranking and `cheapest` uses a
  low-budget cheapest repair path instead of all selectors flowing through the
  same worst-removal/regret-2 implementation.
- The CVRP adapter-rendered `destroy_repair_policy` interface now lists valid
  `destroy_selectors`, `repair_selectors`, and `subset_strategy` values
  explicitly, including a warning not to put `single_worst` or `route_diverse`
  in `destroy_selectors`.
- The latest enum-interface rerun validates that model-facing repair but also
  demonstrates the limit of policy-by-policy exposure: 7 valid screened
  `destroy_repair_policy` candidates made 7,168 destroy/repair attempts across
  112 pairs with zero accepted current/recovery/phase-best moves and
  `destroy_repair_phase_delta_sum=0.0`.

Do not run long CVRP validation until a short diagnostic shows nonzero
phase-best improvement and screening-quality movement.

## Current Engineering State

### Framework Boundary

- Framework prompt assembly no longer hardcodes warehouse/VNS/CVRP mechanics.
- Problem-specific mechanics, objective semantics, feasibility, and runtime
  evidence interpretation live in problem adapters/packages.
- `ProblemSpecV1.research_surfaces` is the forward-compatible abstraction for
  optimization targets.
- Contract, Verification, Protocol, and Decision are surface-aware without
  embedding CVRP/warehouse-specific logic in core.
- Runtime env passthrough is generic for `SCION_*` variables.
- Legacy non-adapter paths remain compatibility-only; new problems should use
  `ProblemAdapter`.

### Campaign And APS

- `campaign.py` is now mostly a facade over extracted proposal, evaluation,
  promotion, evidence, failure-lifecycle, branch-stepping, workspace, and
  decision services.
- APS uses a two-phase proposal path for research/hypothesis and code
  implementation.
- Forced-surface controls are carried into APS tool context and fail closed
  before code generation.
- APS feedback defaults to same-campaign or forced-surface history for forced
  diagnostics.
- Tool observations are rendered into final hypothesis/code prompts.
- Observation-budget pressure is mitigated by compact surface reads, compact
  preview payloads, and a self-check/static-preview reserve. Optional planner
  surface reads fail closed before consuming the reserve.
- Campaign-level forced-surface diagnostics now carry the forced
  surface/action/target into APS tools and the final CreativeLayer hypothesis
  task. APS still fails closed if a model produces an off-surface hypothesis.

### CVRP Runtime

- CVRP `.vrp` runs can use the repo-local `vrp/src` ALNS+VNS baseline when
  `SCION_PROBLEM_DATA_ROOT` points at the repo `vrp` directory.
- Required-baseline fallback or baseline errors are runtime audit failures, not
  objective ties.
- CVRPLIB internal node ids from `vrp/src` are mapped back into Scion's
  depot-first CVRP id space.
- Generated registry operators stop after a complete no-improvement round, so
  no-op post-baseline operators do not repeat for 20 rounds.
- Malformed, infeasible, exception-raising, or audit-incomplete outputs fail
  closed.

### CVRP Research Surfaces

CVRP currently exposes these declared surfaces:

- `route_local`
- `route_pair`
- `ruin_recreate`
- `search_policy`
- `baseline_policy`
- `construction_policy`
- `neighborhood_portfolio`
- `algorithm_blueprint`
- `main_search_strategy`
- `alns_vns_policy`
- `destroy_repair_policy`
- `route_pair_candidate_policy`
- `acceptance_restart_policy`

`main_search_strategy` is the orchestration diagnostic surface. It is a
singleton policy in `policies/main_search_strategy.py` and can coordinate:

- bounded construction ensemble;
- repo-local baseline budget and sanitized baseline params;
- package-owned improvement components: `intra_route_2opt`,
  `inter_route_relocate`, `route_pair_swap`, `bounded_destroy_repair`;
- strict-improvement acceptance threshold;
- restart and perturbation knobs, including explicit perturbation schedule;
- optional registry-operator round limit.

Current limitation: this surface list is now too component-centric. It exposes
many legal hooks, but it does not yet give Scion a coherent CVRP problem object
to research. The next slice should redesign adapter/problem-spec rendering so
Scion sees the instance model, solution representation, constraints, objective
policy, move/design affordances, solver lifecycle, and whole-solver evidence
as one problem-owned research object. Stop forced policy diagnostics until that
slice is designed.

## Latest Experiment

Latest analyzed run:

```text
run_root=/home/clawd/research/scion-experiments/v04-forced-destroy-repair-policy-enum-interface-sonnet-8r-20260511T114551Z
model=claude-sonnet-4-6
problem=cvrp
protocol=formal
rounds_requested=8
rounds_completed=8
time_limit_sec=20
agentic_proposal=true
agentic_session_timeout_sec=480

analysis_doc=scion/docs/experiments/v0.4/v0.4-forced-destroy-repair-policy-enum-interface-sonnet-8r-20260511.md
```

Summary:

- The run completed all 8 requested rounds and stopped by
  `max_rounds_exhausted`; `circuit_breaker_tripped=false`.
- All 8 hypotheses targeted `modify/destroy_repair_policy` and
  `policies/destroy_repair_policy.py`. No forced-surface violation appeared in
  `campaign_summary.json`.
- The forced task line remains validated in real traces: all 8 hypothesis
  traces contained the forced `destroy_repair_policy` task line, and 0
  contained the old generic "Choose a research surface from ..." task line.
- The enum-interface repair is validated: all 7 completed code sessions passed
  `proposal.contract_preview`, and `verification_failure_breakdown={}`.
- Solver efficacy still failed: 7 candidates reached screening and all failed
  `SCREENING_FAIL_WIN_RATE`; all had `win_rate=0.125` and `median_delta=0.0`.
- One round failed at hypothesis Contract with `C10_novelty` because the
  structured novelty signature omitted required destroy/repair identity fields.
- Destroy/repair attribution was complete but non-beneficial across 112
  screened pairs: 7,168 attempts, 7,168 repair-budget units used, zero accepted
  current/recovery/phase-best moves, and
  `destroy_repair_phase_delta_sum=0.0`.
- The valid policies exercised both `regret_2` and `cheapest`, both allowed
  destroy selectors, and max-destroy/budget patterns from 2..10 and 6..16. The
  mechanism still produced only `repair_budget_exhausted` or
  `repair_produced_no_improvement`.

Interpretation: `destroy_repair_policy` is no longer blocked by prompt routing,
selector implementation, or selector enum clarity. It is exhausted as a forced
diagnostic target for the current solver-owned mechanism. More importantly,
this run confirms that continuing to force one policy hook at a time is the
wrong optimization strategy. The next step is the problem-object adaptation
pivot, not another forced policy run.

## Next Actions

P1:

- Stop forced single-policy diagnostics for now, including
  `route_pair_candidate_policy`.
- Design the CVRP problem-object adaptation slice: what Scion should see about
  the instance model, solution model, constraints, objective policy,
  route/move affordances, solver lifecycle, and whole-solver evidence.
- Decide whether the next top-level research target is a broad
  solver-design/problem-object surface rather than the existing singleton
  component policies.
- Update adapter rendering and problem-spec metadata so the Creative Layer
  reasons from that problem object instead of a menu of local knobs.
- After that slice exists, run one short diagnostic campaign to validate that
  Scion can produce solver-level hypotheses with attributable whole-solver
  runtime movement.

P2:

- Persist actual `DecisionFeatures` lineage and improve soft-abandon decision
  provenance.
- Move remaining problem-specific runtime-field heuristics out of proposal
  context.
- Consider a typed-collaborator pass for campaign composition to reduce
  callback coupling.
- Add a dedicated CLI/readiness command for formal campaign closeout.
- Fix model-facing tool-selection prompt sanitization that can render
  `feedback.query_holdout_summary` as an empty allowed tool name.

## Remaining Risks

- CVRP `main_search_strategy` is too shallow by itself to produce meaningful
  algorithmic gains; without explicit deep-surface prioritization, agents
  mostly revisit orchestration and legacy policy surfaces.
- CVRP's current research-surface set is over-fragmented. It risks optimizing
  whatever hook is exposed rather than the problem's solver design.
- Deep-surface runtime attribution is improved for `alns_vns_policy` and
  mechanically complete for `destroy_repair_policy`, but still thin for
  `acceptance_restart_policy` and `route_pair_candidate_policy`.
- `destroy_repair_policy` now has validated prompt routing, selector semantics,
  enum clarity, and complete runtime attribution, but no useful movement in the
  current solver-owned mechanism.
- Proposal preview and runtime audit can still disagree for strategies that
  are syntactically valid but semantically incompatible with diagnostic
  expectations.
- Runtime isolation is resource-limited and env-sanitized, but not yet a full
  read-only mount sandbox.
- Stale/reconcile semantics still need a dedicated v3-aligned review.
- Legacy/no-adapter V8 objective-only comparison remains compatibility-only.
